    1.1.1 Background

	I have chosen to design a website for an animal shelter, specialized in rescuing, nursing, and getting into adoption rescued animals. The non-profit charity which owns this shelter rely on public donations and volunteers to achieve their goal: to rescue as many animals as possible. The issue of abandoned or maltreated animals is particularly important to me: I have owned cats and dogs since childhood, and I was taught to respect and love all the animals. Unfortunately, in Romania, my birth country, for many years we have the street dogs’ problem and many private organizations have tried to reduce the number of stray dogs and to educate people not to abandon animals anymore, but to sterilize them and treat them with affection. I own a cat, found abandoned on the streets, few weeks after it was born.
	To create the website, I studied few shelter portals, especially http://www.4animals.ro which gave me the starting ideas, but when I began to sketch the wireframe, I have used my own vision.
