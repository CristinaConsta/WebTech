            <p>Poppy animal shelter is a nonprofit organizaton based in London, UK. Our mission is to save animals who have been forgotten, mistreated or lonely, and give them a save haven in which to prosper untill a wonderful person decides to take them home and offer them all of their love. We have many races and breeds of animals from all over London and neighbouring citiesm, and work closely with veterinarians to make sure all of our animals are as healthy as possible.</p>

        <fieldset><legend>Voluntary work</legend>
            <p>The volunteers are very important in our organization. More than half of our staff is made of volunteers who work part-time to offer help feeding, washing, cleaning up after and caring for the animals in our shelter. Although some of the volunteers are veterinary students, we have unspecialised staff as well for taking care of all manner of animal needs. More volunteers are always welcome to join and help us. If you want to join, go to the Contact us page and submit a short description of why you want to join and if you have any qualifications, or see us in person for a short interview.</p>
