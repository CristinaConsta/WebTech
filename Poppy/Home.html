                <h3>New born kittens found on Main road</h3>
                <p>Last week, on Main Road, our volunteers have found a big box with new born kittens.</P>
                <p>There were starved, dehydrated and very frightened, but they trusted our people and accepted the help.</p>

                <p>Back to our shelter, the kittens were fed, cared for, and vaccinated. Now all of them are in good health and waiting to be adopted.</p>

                <h3>Big donation received</h3>
                <p>As always, we rely on donations offered by good people in our community, as well as on our long-time partners.</p>
                <p>Yesterday we had a big surprise, receiving a substantial pet food donation from a loving family, which wanted to remain anonymous. They have adopted a puppy last year and on every one of his birthdays, they make a substantial donation to our shelter.</p>

                <p>Many thanks from us and especially from our little friends!</p>
